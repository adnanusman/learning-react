# Learning and Applying React

## How to use

Simply drag the html files into your browser.

### I was following Tyler Mcginnis and his free React Bootcamp.

All the Day html files are going to reflect code that I worked on and learnt to read/work with in Tyler's Free Bootcamp which you will find here:

I may add more from as I keep learning and applying React.

These are for me to refer back to and add to as time goes by.
